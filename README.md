## 🎯 Goals & Philosophy  
This portfolio is more than a static site — it's a **living document of my development career**.

- To present myself professionally  
- To demonstrate growth across academic and personal projects  
- To serve as a central hub for recruiters and collaborators  
- To evolve as I evolve  
- To reflect both craftsmanship *and* continuous learning  

It is equal parts **school project**, **professional branding**, and **personal passion project**.

---

## 🌱 Current Status  
The site is fully reorganized with a clean file structure and working local build.

Next milestones:

- Add PHP backend for the contact form  
- Expand project pages with richer descriptions  
- Improve accessibility and responsiveness  
- Deploy the updated version to **vader941.dev**
