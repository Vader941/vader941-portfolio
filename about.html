        <div class="about-intro">
          <p>I’m a student developer who enjoys building things that make a difference, especially tools that help people learn in ways that fit how they think. Analytical and thorough by nature, I approach every project with a focus on mechanics and impact: what the user experiences on the front end and how it functions under the hood.</p>

          <p>My interest in educational software is personal. I’m the father of a bright, funny, and autistic 10-year-old who learns best through interaction and play. Watching how he processes the world, excelling at games and logic but struggling in traditional classrooms, has pushed me to imagine better ways technology can support neurodivergent learners. My long-term goal is to combine my technical skills and his insights to build accessible, interactive learning tools for children like him.</p>

          <p>I’m most at home when I can take a clear goal and figure out the best way to reach it. I like to make projects interactive, refine what already exists, and balance independence with collaboration, working toward shared results without micromanagement.</p>

          <p>Whether I’m scripting a new feature, troubleshooting an app, or rethinking a system from the ground up, I aim for the same outcome: solutions that work cleanly, help people, and keep improving over time.</p>
